# Usage Policy - Stake Pool Registry

### 1. Summary

This GitHub repository (“Repository”) provides a means for Stake Pool Operators (as defined below) to register stake pools for the Incentivised Testnet (“Incentivised Testnet”). Ada holders are encouraged to delegate their stake to pools via dedicated test wallets and/or to register stake pools (“Stake Pool(s)”), which participate in block creation. Ada holders who would like to register and actively operate such registered Stake Pools (“Stake Pool Operator(s)” / “Operator(s)”) must comply with this Usage Policy for Stake Pool Registrations (“Usage Policy”), which includes restrictions on the content they post, their conduct while operating a Stake Pool, and other limitations. By requesting to register a Stake Pool (see below), the applying Stake Pool Operator confirms to having read and understood the Usage Policy and he/she agrees to be bound by it.

### 2. Registration process

New registrations of Stake Pools and Stake Pool modifications will take the form of a Github pull request (the “Request(s)”) into the Incentivised Testnet Repository. These Requests will be subject to automated checking as well as a manual vetting process. When reviewing incoming requests, their content will especially be checked with regards to the below outlined Content and Conduct Restrictions. Requests may be approved or rejected without providing reason.
